For most articles, you'd need to add a screenshot of your application, this is usually done at the end of your article body. You can add the screenshot using the guidelines listed below 

- Images and screenshots should come from your own application preferably.
- For accessibility reasons, you should add an alt text to your images and screenshots.
- Please make sure your images and screenshots are not too large, they should be less than 1MB in size.
- Images/screenshots should be taken in a resolution of 1440 x 840 pixels or a 16:9 aspect ratio/dimension.
- When taking screenshots, please only capture the actual window content (the actual browser UI elements should not be visible).
